Bertrand Russell - Philosophical Works and Letters (76 books)

BERTRAND RUSSELL (1872-1970) was a British philosopher, logician, mathematician, historian, writer, social critic, and political activist.  At various points in his life, Russell considered himself a liberal, a socialist and a pacifist, but he also admitted that he had "never been any of these things, in any profound sense".  He was awarded the 1950 Nobel Prize in Literature "in recognition of his varied and significant writings in which he champions humanitarian ideals and freedom of thought."

In the early 20th century, Russell led the British "revolt against idealism".  He is considered one of the founders of analytic philosophy along with his predecessor Gottlob Frege, colleague G. E. Moore and protégé Ludwig Wittgenstein.  He is widely held to be one of the 20th century's premier logicians.  With Alfred North Whitehead he wrote PRINCIPIA MATHEMATICA, an attempt to create a logical basis for mathematics.  His philosophical essay "On Denoting" has been considered a "paradigm of philosophy".  His work has had a considerable influence on mathematics, logic, set theory, linguistics, artificial intelligence, cognitive science, computer science, and philosophy, especially the philosophy of language, epistemology and metaphysics.

To the general public, he was best known as an anti-war activist and as a popular writer on social, political, and moral subjects.  He went to prison for his pacifism during World War I.  Russell later concluded war against Adolf Hitler was a necessary "lesser of two evils" and criticized Stalinist totalitarianism, attacked the involvement of the United States in the Vietnam War and was an outspoken proponent of nuclear disarmament.
